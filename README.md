shaun — A Terminal-Based Portfolio That Talks Back
"Because sometimes a LinkedIn link just doesn't cut it."
shaun is a Python package built to be more than just a portfolio. It’s an interactive CLI experience designed to spark conversations, showcase projects, and sneak in a few tech-savvy jokes — all while living in your terminal.

🚀 Installation
pip install shaun

💡 What Is This?

Imagine installing someone’s portfolio and actually chatting with it. That’s what shaun is. Once installed, you'll get access to a set of commands that let you:
💬 Ask "U got jokes?" for a stream of dark, dad, tech, or pop-culture-inspired humor
📜 Browse through past and current projects in AI, automation, and venture building
🔍 Peek behind the curtain into the mind of a data scientist / founder / builder
🤝 Connect with the human side — mindset, motivations, and the mission behind the grind

⚙️ Try It Like This
shaun

Then type:
U got jokes?
Or:
Tell me your story
More commands = more surprises. Seriously, try typing like you're texting someone who codes in Python and quotes Tony Stark.

🧠 Who's Behind This?
"Think technical problem-solver meets business strategist – I can code a multi-modal AI assistant in the morning and pitch a SaaS idea by lunch."
Hi, I’m Shaun — a data scientist by degree, self-taught across Python, AI/ML, business, and design. I’ve built:

🤖 Explainable AI object classifiers
📲 Social media automation bots
🧠 An AI debate platform where multiple models tackle complex questions
🚀 Ventures in ed-tech, gaming, and consumer products
Currently building in stealth, investing on the side, and always looking to connect with sharp, curious minds.

🎭 Personality Download
🧮 Finance-minded adrenaline junkie
💼 Builds in silence, launches with impact
👨‍👩‍👧 Family-first, freedom-focused
🎧 Kendrick and Eminem on repeat while coding
🤯 Torn between CEO boardrooms and peaceful farmland life (seriously)

🤝 Let’s Connect
If you’ve installed this, we’re already vibing on a different wavelength.
You can:
Fork it, explore the code and build your own CLI portfolio
Use it to reach out — ideas, collabs or just talk shop

🔧 Coming Soon
More CLI Easter eggs 🎁
Terminal-based Q&A with project demos
Integration with GitHub & LinkedIn
Easter-egg “AI pitch mode” — let the CLI pitch you an idea

🧬 Why?

Because your portfolio should feel like you.
And sometimes, that means throwing in a dark joke, a SaaS pitch, and a little Tony Stark energy.
